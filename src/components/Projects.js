We need an experienced construction contractor to supervise the project and handle the construction. We are looking for a honest and talented person as we're willing to work in the long term. The height of contractor must be atleast 6 feet to apply as we believe long people can work in long term. Don't forget to make sure you have strong portfolio. Honesty is the best policy.
